# Fifa predictions

FIFA games try to represent faithfully the ability of real life players through a
exhaustive list of abilities. Players in the game not only have attributes for
the different skills involved in a football match (speed, shooting, tackling, etc),
but a potential value that determines how the skills of the players will evolve
through the years.

While the other skills can be compared to the real skills of the actual players,
knowing if the potential skill is the right one involves comparing the evolution
of the player in the next years. To do this, I will compare the evolution of statistics
of several young playes from Fifa 19 to Fifa21 and check if the potential value
they got in Fifa 19 reflects the evolution these players have had.

## increase_by_pot.py

Playes from Fifa 19 are grouped by potential to check if the overall value of the
players in different groups is the same.

## increase_by_average.py

The players from Fifa 19 are grouped by overall value. Then I analyze the relation
between potential and evolution of overall for players that had the same overall in
Fifa 19.
